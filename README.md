# Using React Hooks ⚛️

I've been studying <strong>React Hooks</strong> for a couple of months ago, so in this application I wanted to use the most used React Hooks.

This application performs a search to [The Rick and Morty API
](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) where it fetches the 20 most pouplar characters from the series.

The knowledge that I wanted to put in practice in this app was the use of the following React Hooks:

- [useState](https://devdocs.io/react/hooks-reference#usestate)
- [useEffect](https://devdocs.io/react/hooks-reference#useeffect)
- [useContext](https://devdocs.io/react/hooks-reference#usecontext)
- [useReducer](https://devdocs.io/react/hooks-reference#usereducer)
- [useMemo](https://devdocs.io/react/hooks-reference#usememo)
- [useRef](https://devdocs.io/react/hooks-reference#useref)
- [useCallback](https://devdocs.io/react/hooks-reference#usecallback)
